Whether this is your first or tenth time participating in Hacktoberfest, we invite you to contribute to this open source project.
## General Info
This repository is made for people who are willing to submit their development project as an open source contribution for Hacktoberfest. The purpose of this is to create a space where people can get started, ask for help, and contribute as much as possible.
## Contributing
